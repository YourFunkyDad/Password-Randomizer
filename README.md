# Password-Randomizer

I am tasked with building a Password Generator, but my JavaScript skills are still not as good as my Google-foo. Using the snapshot code as a template, I have found the challenge easier to complete using outside resources along with my module work. 

Setting up the GitHub repository correctly still seems to be my biggest challenge. Making sure I am on the correct working tree, and making sure I am not pushing/pulling incorrectly still has me stuttering in my work-flow. 

After lots of help from Google, I am starting to familiarize myself with some of the JS language. Creating functions, making variables and constants has proven to be difficult and immediately headache inducing. 

I know what I am submitting is not to the exact criteria of the module, but I was wanting to submit something to show that I am attempting to get better everyday.
