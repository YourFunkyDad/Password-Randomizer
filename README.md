# Password-Randomizer

I am tasked with building a Password Generator, but my JavaScript skills are still not as good as my Google-foo. Using the snapshot code as a template, I have found the challenge easier to complete using outside resources along with my module work. 

Setting up the GitHub repository correctly still seems to be my biggest challenge. Making sure I am on the correct working tree, and making sure I am not pushing/pulling incorrectly still has me stuttering in my work-flow.
